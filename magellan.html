    <p>Ferdinand Magellan was a Portuguese navigator and explorer who became the first European to sail the Pacific Ocean and the first to sail around the world. Magellan's voyage is said to have proved that the Earth was round. He was also the first to sail through the Strait of Magellan, so it was named after him.</p>
    <p>
        Magellan's parents were members of the Portuguese nobility, after their deaths, he became a page for the queen at the age of 10. In the royal court, he learned many important skills, including map-making, navigation, and astronomy. 
        In 1505, when he was 25, he joined the navy.
