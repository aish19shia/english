    <h1>SIR FRANCIS DRAKE</h1>
  
    

    <p>Francis Drake's father was a minister for the navy and Francis grew up near the sea. He went to work for a sea captain at a young age and found his home living and working on a ship. <br><br>
            His first expedition was with John Hawkins. He captained the ship <mark>Judith</mark> , one of six ships that made up the fleet. Hawkins first led the fleet to Africa then they sailed across the Atlantic to the New World.</p>
